<p>Another early history of the discovery of the Philippines, which appeared in 1708 in London. This work is a translation from the Spanish of a book by Bartolomé Leonardo de Argensola (1562-1631) that appeared almost a century earlier. Translated in English by John Stevens (-1726). Parts of this material has also appeared in much later translation in Blair & Robertson.</p> 

<p>I've marked this work as HARD, as the OCR has considerable problems with the print, I've downloaded from http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAD4285.0001.001. You may decide it is easier to type it in instead.</p> 

<p>This work, like many 18th century works uses the old long s, which looks like a f without a cross-bar. We here represent it as a normal s.</p> 

<p>The many sidenotes should be placed in brackets, in front, or after the line they appear, like this [Sidenote: ..... ]. Please don't forget the final period in the side-note, if present.</p> 

<p style="color:red"> Please place sidenotes directly next to the line they apply to, not to the top of the (often very long) paragraphs.

<p>The little word on the bottom-right of the page, representing the first word of the next page can be omitted.</p> 

<p>Do not attempt to correct the spelling in any way, we will leave it exactly as in the original, even obvious mistakes (though you can mark these with an asterisk).</p>
